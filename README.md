# ARIMA-SPY-Time-Series-Forecasting
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model converts non-stationary data to stationary data before working on it. 
It is one of the most popular models to predict linear time series data.
The data shows the stock price of SPY from 2015-03-20 till 2020-03-19. 
The goal is to train an ARIMA model with optimal parameters that will forecast the closing price of the stocks on the test data.
